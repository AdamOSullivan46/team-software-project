# Downloading the project and making changes

Before you can make changes to the code, you'll have to download it to your local machine so you can open it up in your editor. If you're already familiar with git and github, all you need to know is: don't make commits to master. Make a branch, commit on there, and make a pull request back to master. If you're not familiar, here's a short guide:

1. Download and install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

   In theory, you can do all of this stuff from the command line, but it's a total headache and github desktop makes it much easier. There's also a lot of github-specific conventions that are difficult to remember (how does github handle rebasing? how exactly are commits squashed?). If you know what you're doing, feel free to ignore all the github-specific stuff, but "there be dragons" etc.
   
2. Download the repository.

   Go to [the main page for the repo](https://github.com/oisdk/team-software-project) and click the green button marked "clone or download", and then click "open in desktop"
